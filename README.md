# Quranic Analysis

I thought this project is small, and direct to the point; but it seems that it is something that is huge. 
I will with the help of god continously update this project, regulary starting from 9/3/2025 till 15/4/2025
so probably a Month of work



# what I need ?

tools to analyze the quran 
tools that may help is : 
- pyquran
- vector things
- sematic analysis {the meaning of words}
- scraping the sayed sistani website and seeing how it can relate to the holy quran
- RAG to just look at the holy quran and nothing else related to it

# How would i tackle this project

1. make a quick analysis that is just as general as possible
2. reframe the questions to be more direct and answer them one by one, refrain from super broad questions
3. make something to present it, on the CAPSTONE day
4. get to see oppourtunities in this area


# ChatGPT SUGGESTIONS
1. Use `PyQuran` to retrieve and analyze Quranic text. - EXPLORE THIS
2. Apply `vector embeddings` to create a `semantic search engine` for `Quranic words/phrases.` - HOW ? AWD ? BERT ?
3. Perform semantic analysis to understand deeper meanings of Quranic verses. - HOW ?
4. Scrape Sistaniâ€™s website to compare Islamic rulings with Quranic references.
5. Use `RAG` to build an AI-powered Quran Q&A chatbot that ensures Quran-only answers. - THIS I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT
